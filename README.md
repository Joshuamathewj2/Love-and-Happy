```env
ADMIN_PASSCODE=your-admin-passcode
STAFF_PASSCODE=your-staff-passcode
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@hostname/dbname?sslmode=require

- Public store page: `/`
- POS terminal: `/pos/admin/secure/control-panel/raja-mobiles`
- Digital invoice: `/invoice/[invoice-id]`

## Data Model

- **products** — master price list. Each product has a `selling_price`, a `gst_rate` (default GST %, editable at billing), and an `hsn_code`.
- **customers**, **orders**, **order_items** — sales records. `orders.is_gst` flags GST invoices vs non-GST bills, which powers the two revenue dashboards.

See `schema.sql` for the full schema.

## Roles

- **Staff** — Billing Panel, Order History (view-only).
- **Admin** — Full access, including Inventory CRUD, Analytics, and delete permissions.

The role is determined by which passcode is used to log in.
